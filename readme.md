# Songyt



Songyt helps find Youtube videos of the song you are listening to on your Android device. By capturing notification data and sending it to Youtube's API, it opens up the best matching video of the song playing on the Google Play Music or Spotify apps (Pandora and more coming soon!) based on artist and song title. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
```
Android v4.4 (19)
Google Play Music OR Spotify 
```

### Running Songyt

Coming soon to Google Play. If you'd like to run an alpha version of the software, contact me via [njromano.com](njromano.com).

After installation, you must allow Songyt to access your notifications via device settings. The application will prompt you when it detects it cannot read them and direct you to the correct settings page.

To find a video of your currently playing song, tap the search button on the Songyt app. Songyt will automatically attempt to find and open the closest matching music video on YouTube (results may vary).
